# Reproducible research: version control and R

## Questions 1, 2 and 3)

Questions 1, 2 and 3 were answered in the README.md file of the logistic_growth repo forked during the practical. The link to these answers is shown here: https://github.com/1074661/logistic_growth. 

## Question 4)

i) Executing the provided code gives two side-by-side random walk plots that are the result of two independent iterations of the function 'random_walk'. Each plot shows a unique trajectory of 500 steps even though each plot was produced by running the same function (random_walk) for 500 steps. Time is shown by a gradient colour scheme (ranging from dark blue to light blue), allowing visualisation of how random walks changed temporally; earlier steps correspond with darker blue and later steps correspond with light blue. While each step on the random walk has a set distance (0.25 units), a random angle between 0 and 2pi is generated for each step to produce a random path over the 500 iterations. The combination of angle and step length information is used to compute (x,y) coordinates after each step. While both paths begin from the origin (0,0), the random nature of the walk results in the following of distinct trajectories. Production of a unique random_walk plot each time the random_walk function is iterated during code re-running (due to path reliance on random generation of an angle for each step) means that this simulation lacks reproducibility.

ii) A random seed is an initial number used as a fixed starting point to initialise a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) in R. Use of a random seed ensures replicability and reproducibility of results of a random process (such as Brownian motion). This is because the random seed allows researchers to reproduce the same sequence of numbers generated by a PRNG in R. 

iii) I edited the script to make a reproducible simulation of Brownian motion. **This edited script is shown below**. 

```{r}
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("gridExtra")

library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)

random_walk  <- function (n_steps, seed = 100) {

  set.seed(seed)

# Adding this arbitrary random seed inside the random_walk function renders the simulation of Brownian motion reproducible. 
# Plot1 and plot2 show the same random walk trajectory output because the same random seed was inputted into the function'random_walk' run over 500 steps in data1 and data2. 
  
  df <- data.frame(x = rep(NA, n_steps), y = rep(NA, n_steps), time = 1:n_steps)
  
  df[1,] <- c(0,0,1)
  
  for (i in 2:n_steps) {
    
    h <- 0.25
    
    angle <- runif(1, min = 0, max = 2*pi)
    
    df[i,1] <- df[i-1,1] + cos(angle)*h
    
    df[i,2] <- df[i-1,2] + sin(angle)*h
    
    df[i,3] <- i
    
  }
  
  return(df)
  
}

data1 <- random_walk(500)

plot1 <- ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y), data = data1) +
  
  geom_path(aes(colour = time)) +
  
  theme_bw() +
  
  xlab("x-coordinate") +
  
  ylab("y-coordinate")

data2 <- random_walk(500)

plot2 <- ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y), data = data2) +
  
  geom_path(aes(colour = time)) +
  
  theme_bw() +
  
  xlab("x-coordinate") +
  
  ylab("y-coordinate")

grid.arrange(plot1, plot2, ncol=2)
```

To ensure reproducibility of the Brownian motion simulation, I added the set.seed() function, using an arbitrary random seed, inside the random_walk function. Evidence that the simulation is reproducible is that plot1 and plot2 show the same random walk trajectory output (shown below). This occurs because the same random seed was inputted into the function'random_walk' run over 500 steps in data1 and data2.

## Question 5)

i) The code below informs that there are 33 rows and 13 columns in the table. 

```{r}
dsDNAviruses_data <- read.csv("Cui_etal2014.csv")
ncol(dsDNAviruses_data)
nrow(dsDNAviruses_data)
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b1b27ba-bdd1-4fb3-a793-8a1f7ba450de)

ii) In order that a linear model (in the form y = a + bx) can be fitted to the data, a log transformation can be applied such that:

$$V = αL^β$$ Is transformed to $$ln(V) = ln(α) + βln(L)$$

```{r}
# Cleaning data and applying transformation to data
dsDNAviruses_data$log_volume <- log(dsDNAviruses_data$Virion.volume..nm.nm.nm.)
dsDNAviruses_data$bases <- (dsDNAviruses_data$Genome.length..kb.)
dsDNAviruses_data$log_bases <- log(dsDNAviruses_data$bases)

# Applying a linear model (in the form y = a + bx) to data
linearmodel <- lm(log_volume ~ log_bases, data = dsDNAviruses_data)
summary(linearmodel)
```

iii) The linear model is $$ln(V) = ln(α) + βln(L)$$

#### Output of summary(linearmodel)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55858dda-237c-4c02-9916-66f365c3684b)

Per the summary table, the estimate of the intercept (ln(α)) of the linear model is 7.0748. Therefore, the scaling factor (α) is 1181.81 (since e^7.0748 is 1181.807116). Per the summary table, the P-value for the intercept is 2.28 x 10^-10, which is highly statistically significant (<<< 0.01 significance level threshold). 

Per the summary table, the estimate of the gradient (β) of the linear model is 1.5152. Therefore, the exponent (β) is 1.52. Per the summary table, the P-value for the gradient is 6.44 x 10^-10, which is highly statistically significant (<<< 0.01 significance level threshold). 

In Table 2 from Cui et al. (2014), for the allometric relationship between dsDNA virion volume and dsDNA virion genome length, the allometric exponent is 1.52 and the scaling factor is 1182.

Therefore, my scaling factor is the same as that found by Cui et al. (2014) when rounded to the nearest whole number, and my allometric exponent is the same as that found by Cui et al. (2014).

iv) The code to reproduce the figure is shown below.

```{r}
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = dsDNAviruses_data, aes(x=log_bases, y=log_volume)) + 
  geom_point() +
  xlab("log [Genome length (kb)]") + 
  ylab("log [Virion volume (nm3)]") +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm') +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.border = element_rect(color = "black", fill = NA, linewidth = 1))
```
#### Output of code
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a79c675c-7f04-448d-b27c-4a09085db35d)

v) $$V = αL^β$$

V = (1181.807116)*((300)^1.5152) = 6,700,000 nm^3 (rounded to 3 s.f.) 

Therefore, the estimated volume of a 300 kb dsDNA virus is 6,700,000 nm^3.

They found that this relationship can be modelled using an allometric equation of the form **$`V = \alpha L^{\beta}`$**, where $`V`$ is the virion volume in nm<sup>3</sup> and $`L`$ is the genome length in nucleotides.
